## TASK DESCRIPTION-

The task is to make a real-time chat application where people can send and receive messages instantly. The goal of this project is to show how a full-stack web application works, with a frontend (what the user sees) and a backend (the server that handles data). This project is useful because chat apps are common in the real world, and building one shows skills in both client-side and server-side development.
The application has two main parts: the client and the server. The client is built with React. React is a tool that helps developers build user interfaces in a simple way. It allows us to create components like chat bubbles, input boxes, and contact lists. In this app, the client shows the chat screen, lets users type messages, and displays messages in a style similar to WhatsApp. It also has features like pressing Enter to send a message, showing multiple users, and updating the chat instantly when new messages arrive.
The server is built with Node.js and Express. Node.js is a tool that lets JavaScript run on the server. Express is a framework that makes it easier to handle routes and server logic. The server uses WebSocket, which is a special way for the client and server to talk to each other in real time. Unlike normal web requests, WebSocket keeps a connection open so that messages can be sent and received instantly. This is what makes the app “real-time.” When one user sends a message, the server passes it to all connected users without delay.
The app also uses MongoDB, which is a database. A database is needed to store chat history so that messages are not lost when users close the app. MongoDB is good for this because it can store data in a flexible way. Each message can be saved with details like who sent it, what the text was, and when it was sent. This makes the app more reliable and closer to what real chat apps do.
Another important part of the task is using Git and GitHub. Git is a version control system that helps track changes in code. GitHub is a platform where the code can be stored online. In this project, GitHub is used to keep the code safe, share it with others, and show the work to reviewers. The repository has a clear structure: one folder for the client, one for the server, a .gitignore file to ignore unnecessary files, and a README.md file to explain the project. The README is important because it tells others what the project is, what features it has, and how to run it.
The purpose of this task is not only to build a working chat app but also to show professional skills. It shows knowledge of frontend tools like React, backend tools like Node.js and Express, real-time communication with WebSocket, and database integration with MongoDB. It also shows the ability to use GitHub properly, handle conflicts, and write clean documentation. These are all skills that companies look for in developers.
From a user’s point of view, the app is simple and easy to use. They can open the app, type a message, and see it appear instantly in another user’s window. From a developer’s point of view, the app shows how different parts of a system work together: the client, the server, and the database. It also shows how to manage code and share it online.
In short, this task is about building a real-world project that is technically sound and professionally presented. It proves the ability to create something useful, solve problems, and work with modern web technologies. The Real-Time Chat Application is a strong example of practical learning and can be used to show skills during internship reviews or job applications.
