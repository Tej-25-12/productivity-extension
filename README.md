## TASK DESCRIPTION-

This project implements a complete productivity tracking system that integrates a Chrome extension frontend, a Node.js backend, and a MongoDB database. The primary objective of the task is to monitor the time a user spends on specific websites, store this information locally, and then synchronize it with a backend service for persistent storage and reporting. By combining multiple technologies into one cohesive workflow, the project demonstrates practical skills in frontend development, backend integration, database management, and full-stack deployment.

The **Chrome extension** serves as the user-facing component. It is defined by a `manifest.json` file that specifies the popup interface (`popup.html`) and supporting script (`popup.js`). When the user clicks on the extension icon in Chrome, the popup opens and displays a report of site usage. This report is generated by retrieving data from `chrome.storage.local`, where the extension has been tracking the time spent on each domain. The popup lists each site along with the total time spent, converted into seconds for readability. This immediate feedback allows users to understand their browsing habits at a glance.

A key feature of the extension is the **Sync to Backend button**. When clicked, this button triggers a `fetch` request to the backend server running locally on `http://localhost:5000/save`. The request sends JSON data containing the domain name and the total time spent. This ensures that the locally tracked data is not only visible in the popup but also stored permanently in a database for later analysis. The backend responds with a confirmation message such as “Data saved!”, which is displayed to the user as an alert, reinforcing that the synchronization was successful.

The **backend** is implemented using Node.js with the Express framework. It defines an endpoint `/save` that accepts POST requests from the extension. Upon receiving data, the backend connects to MongoDB and inserts a new document into the `sites` collection within the `productivity` database. Each document contains fields for the domain, total time, and a timestamp (`date`). This design ensures that multiple entries can be stored for the same domain, allowing aggregation over time. The backend is lightweight but effective, serving as the bridge between the extension and the database.

The **database layer** uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database well-suited for storing JSON-like documents. Data can be queried directly using `mongosh` or viewed in MongoDB Compass. For example, running `db.sites.find()` displays all stored documents, while aggregation queries such as:

```javascript
db.sites.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$domain", total: { $sum: "$totalTime" } } }
])
```
